# HotelManagemetSystem

# ABSTRACT:
This project is to help the customer with their hotel reservations and helping the hotel with their regular tasks, which includes maintaining a database that stores customer information and services provided from all the different branches.

# OBJECTIVE: 
The main objective is to create a centralized system for a chain of hotels. Centralized System contains all the rates of each hotel room depending on whether it is peak season/offseason.  Customer must pay the bill during check-out for all the services used. Customer can make reservations and pay before check-in. Cancellation charges will be applied if not canceled before check-in time.  A single customer can have multiple reservations in a single booking. customers can check out whenever they want to, but extending their stay is subject to availability. Customers can update their reservations before checkin.

# DESIGN: 
The database has 11 different entities with many other attributes that help us understand what data hotel stores to smoothen the day-to-day activities.
